# Assignment 3 - CSS

In this assignment you need to create a prototype for a webshop using HTML and CSS. The prototype consists of three HTML pages (main page, product page, and shopping cart) and a single stylesheet file (style.css).

Under the `3/samples/` folder of your your GitHub repository you will find screenshots that serve as examples of what you need to create. You don't have to produce the exact same output that is shown on the samples, you can deviate from it in any way you want (especially in the content) as long as you follow the instructions given below.
